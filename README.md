## Project Setup

### **The API**

The following is a description from Codecademy of the API used for this project:

> " For this project, we will be using the Reddit JSON API. There is no maintained documentation but the API is simple enough to use. We will provide you with some pointers on how to use it.
>
> Note that Reddit has 2 APIs: the official API and an undocumented JSON API. You are welcome to use either APIs but we recommend using the JSON API because it doesnâ€™t require an OAuth workflow. Using the JSON API does have limitations such as no write operations. For the purposes of this project, we find the JSON API adequate.
>
> You can take any Reddit URL, add .json at the end of it, and get JSON. For example, if you want to get the Popular page data in JSON:
>
> Original URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/popular/<br>
> JSON URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/popular.json "
